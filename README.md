I kept getting a warning about prop-types, but I wasn’t sure how to fix it. I ended up using the code VSC gave me to fix it, but I’m not fully confident it’s the best solution.
Although it works, and hey, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! :D

Watched YouTube tutorials on React props to understand how to use them, but I still feel like I’m failing a bit. :D However, I did manage to grasp the map() function and use it effectively!

I stole most of the css from last weeks project :D I spend 5 hours writing it last week and it looked really nice

Had issues with updating the cookie count correctly—figured out I needed to use the functional form of setCookieCount.

The basic functionality is good—cookie clicking and upgrades work well.
Using useEffect for auto cookies works smooth

PropTypes still confuses me. I got it working but not sure it’s the best approach.
The UI could be better; it’s functional but plain.
